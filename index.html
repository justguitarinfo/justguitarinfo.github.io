    <h1>Guitar Plateau Breaker</h1>
    <p>Late beginning and intermediate-level guitar players can break their plateau by following a strategically crafted roadmap to 
      becoming musically literate. Music literacy involves 4 things in my opinion: 1) the ability to read, 2) the ability
      to create, 3) the ability to perform, and 4) the ability to listen.</p>
    <h3>What does a plateau look like?</h3>
    <p>There are lots of varying symptoms. <ul>
      <li>Can play open-position (cowboy) chords but unsure why some chords go well with others.</li>
      <li>Over-reliance on shapes and patterns. Tired of playing the pentatonic pattern because it's now becoming boring.</li>
      <li>Don't really know how to utilize the full fretboard.</li>
      <li>Yet to tackle "theory" - not sure where to start.</li>
      <li>Would like to learn how to solo/improvise or would like to learn how to play more melodically.</li>
      <li>General understanding of the instrument/fretboard is lacking.</li>
      <li>Would like to piece together interesting chord progressions and put a melody over them.</li>
      <li>Cannot identify basic chord progressions by ear.</li>
      <li>A feeling of FRUSTRATION because you want to be a competent musician and make good music but don't know where to 
      begin amongst the SEA of information online.</li>
      <li>Looking for a roadmap that will get you from point A (late beginner/intermediate) to B (a competent musician 
        that can express themselves).</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>If you want to get good, get really really really good at the fundamentals</h2>
    <p>The problem with beginners of all instruments is that they try to approximate what the experts are doing.</p>

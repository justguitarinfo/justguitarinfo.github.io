    <h1>Absolute Beginner Acoustic Guitar Course</h1>
    <p>In 2019, I had the opportunity to be an assistant guitar teacher at a local private school for a 1 semester non-performing 
      class. 
      I was asked by the Orchestra director at Juan Diego Catholic High School to help her in coming up with a 
    curriculum that would be challening, fun, and meet the Utah State standards. We started out with just 7 students that fall 
    semester. Once other students outside of the class learned that our students were making quick progress, it quickly grew to 
    over 20 students. (Due to the size of the classroom, it had a soft cap of 20.) </p>
    <p>It was important to me to find a way to have the students play a song on the very first day. I could not find any 
    curriculum that did just that. Most guitar courses start off with playing exercises that are not very fun. I did utilize 
    those types of exercises but only as a way to give the lesson some variety.</p>
    <h2>How to use this curriculum</h2>
    <p>Your practice session should be about 30 minutes long. Practice the "Chords", "Strumming Patterns", and "Fingerstyle" 
    columns for 10 minutes each. You may be on level 20 in the fingerstyle column but only on level 5 on the Strumming 
    Pattern column. That's fine. Work at your own pace.</p>
    <p>The Songs column is an optional assessment category. Begin learning the first song after about 3 weeks.</p>

    <h1>Guitar Plateau Breaker</h1>
    <p>Late beginning and intermediate-level guitar players can break their plateau by following a strategically crafted roadmap to 
      becoming musically literate. Music literacy involves 4 things in my opinion: 1) the ability to read, 2) the ability
      to create, 3) the ability to perform, and 4) the ability to listen.</p>
    <h3>What does a plateau look like?</h3>
    <p>There are lots of varying symptoms. <ul>
      <li>Can play open-position (cowboy) chords but unsure why some chords go well with others.</li>
      <li>Over-reliance on shapes and patterns. Tired of playing the pentatonic pattern because it's now becoming boring.</li>
      <li>Don't really know how to utilize the full fretboard.</li>
      <li>Yet to tackle "theory" - not sure where to start.</li>
      <li>Would like to learn how to solo/improvise or would like to learn how to play more melodically.</li>
      <li>General understanding of the instrument/fretboard is lacking.</li>
      <li>Would like to piece together interesting chord progressions and put a melody over them.</li>
      <li>Cannot identify basic chord progressions by ear.</li>
      <li>A feeling of FRUSTRATION because you want to be a competent musician and make good music but don't know where to 
      begin amongst the SEA of information online.</li>
      <li>Looking for a roadmap that will get you from point A (late beginner/intermediate) to B (a competent musician 
        that can express themselves).</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>If you want to get good, get really really really good at the fundamentals</h2>
    <p>The problem with beginners of all instruments is that they try to approximate what the experts are doing.</p>
    <p>The truth is that there are levels to musicality. Experts are creating fantastic music at the highest level. 
    But there are excellent musicians who are using slightly less complex concepts and STILL making great music. 
    And the truth is that beginner musicians can make beautiful music by becoming experts at the fundamentals.</p>
    <p>The fastest path to learning how to really enjoy playing your instrument is to find the way to maximize 
    the musicality with the least amount of information as possible.</p>
    <p>And the study of endless scales is not how you become a good musician!</p>
    <p>We're going to focus on harmony instead. And the basic building block of harmony is the Triad.</p>
    <h3>It's time that you become a master of the triad</h3>
    <p>Mastering the triad will get you playing beautiful music much faster than trying to master scales and 
    chord-scale relationships. The small irony is that as you master harmony, you'll create much better melodies.</p>

    <h1>Guitar Plateau Breaker</h1>
    <p>Late beginning and intermediate-level guitar players can break their plateau by following a strategically crafted roadmap to 
      becoming musically literate. Music literacy involves 4 things in my opinion: 1) the ability to read, 2) the ability
      to create, 3) the ability to perform, and 4) the ability to listen.</p>
